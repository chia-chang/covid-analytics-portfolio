## Raw data
- **covid_raw_data.csv:** 
  Contains daily time series data tracking key COVID-19 indicators from 2020-03-01 to 2024-01-31. The data captures the evolution of the pandemic across case counts, testing activity,                       hospitalizations, and vaccination rollouts.
  - **columns**:
    - `Date`: Calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD).  
    - `Cases`: Number of confirmed new COVID-19 cases reported each day. Some values are missing (NaN) to reflect real-world reporting gaps.  
    - `Tests`: Number of COVID-19 diagnostic tests performed daily.  
    - `Hospitalizations`: Daily count of COVID-19 hospital admissions, with some missing data points to simulate incomplete reporting.  
    - `Deaths`: Number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 reported each day.  
    - `Vaccinations`: Daily number of vaccinations administered.
  - **generated from**: [Data_Cleaning_and_Integration.ipynb](../notebooks/Data_Cleaning_and_Integration.ipynb)


## Processed data
- **covid_integrated_data.csv:**
  Contains the cleaned and fully integrated COVID-19 dataset generated by the Data_Cleaning_and_Integration.ipynb notebook. The dataset aggregates daily COVID-19 statistics from five separate sources,      organized into a single, consistent timeline.
  - **columns**:
    - `date`: Calendar date for the entry
    - `cases`, `tests`, `hospitalizations`, `deaths`, `vaccinations`: Daily counts
    - Columns ending `_7day_avg`: 7-day rolling average values
    - `positivity_rate`: Daily percent of positive cases among tests
    - Week-over-week changes for each metric
    - Cumulative totals
